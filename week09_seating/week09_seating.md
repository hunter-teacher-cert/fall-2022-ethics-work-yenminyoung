# Airplane Seating

* Read these 3 articles on airplane issues:
  * [Article 1](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/airline-flights-pay-extra-sit-together-split-family-algorithm-minister-a8640771.html)
  * [Article 2](https://thepointsguy.com/news/airlines-purposely-splitting-up-families-make-more-money/)
  * [Article 3](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/do-airlines-split-up-families-so-they-pay-extra-for-seat-allocation-2018-02-05)

* Then, design an algorithm that would seat people more equitably.
* Write up a description of your algorithm
* Make sure this description states how it should improve equity and also how it might affect other concerns.
* NO CODE IS NEEDED OR EXPECTED HERE -- just a description -- but make a note of implementation issues that might make your algorithm more practical or more difficult to implement
* In class next week you will share your ideas and algorithms and ultimately decide on what to recommend to the airlines.
find another example where optimization of one thing has ethical ramifications and unintended consequences. bonus points if it's an ethical optimization (that is, they optimize for a good ethical reason but it has a negative unintended consequence).
