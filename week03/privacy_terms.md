YOUR BREAKOUT MISSION (the last):
- VISIT https://dataprivacylab.org/index.html (how unique am I?)
- READ the "About the Lab" section
- DISCUSS - Where/when are you giving out data unknowingly?
- Time permitting, look over rest of the site...

First look over the references on this page:
https://aboutmyinfo.org/identity/about
Next, select two services: They could be domain-specific (like an education platform); generic (say, Gmail); or could even be two competitors (like two email providers).
Read their privacy policies.
Post the products you are reviewing and comment on one thing for each policy (what it is, why it's good or bad or what raises flags, in your opinion).
If someone posts re: your chosen product before you do, comment on their thread rather than creating a new one.
TASK: Write up a short summary comparing and contrasting. Include an overview of what data is collected and maintained and how they may or may not use it.
If another class member is working on the same two products you can work with them on the writeup. Make sure to include both names and make sure the file is uploaded to both of your repos.
